            </h3>
            <p>
               I really enjoy building my own computers and creating mobile games with Unity. 
               Out of these interests, my favorite is web design, especially the coding part. 
               I've been teaching myself web design since high school, 
               and I've always found joy in writing code and seeing it come to life in a web browser.

                  System Builder
               </h3>
               <p>
                  I've assembled a computer, and I've used it for various activities such as gaming and video editing 
                  in Adobe Premiere Pro during an earlier attempt at starting a YouTube channel that didn't go so well. 
                  Since my childhood, I've harbored a deep desire for owning and utilizing a personal computer. 
                  One of my earliest recollections involving a computer dates back to my sibling showing me how to play checkers. 
                  Remarkably, even at the age of eight, I found it enjoyable, sparking my enduring passion for all things related to computers.

                  <p>
                     If I were to evaluate based on the time invested, 
                     my experience with Unity primarily comprises following 
                     a handful of tutorials aimed at creating basic mobile games. Regrettably, 
                     none of these projects reached a point where I could take be proud of them. Nevertheless, 
                     I remain genuinely intrigued by the prospect of eventually crafting my own game.

               Greetings,
               Please allow me to introduce myself: I am Zachary, but you can call me Zack. As of 2023, I am the age of 20 years old. 
               I am currently in my sophomore year at college, where I am diligently working towards an Associate's Degree in Computer Systems. 
               Another goal I have is to obtain a Mobile App Developer Certificate to further enhance my qualifications.
               My true passion lies within the realm of coding and the multifaceted world of computer science. 
               It never ceases to amaze me how I can transform lines of code into fully functional applications. 
               Currently, I am focused on expanding my professional network and seeking out career opportunities that not only fulfill me but also allow me to gain independence.
               Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I indulge in a variety of hobbies. 
               In order of preference, these include gaming, automotive repair, exploring the culinary arts, and occasional travel.
               I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to explore my portfolio website and getting to know me better.
